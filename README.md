# Architecture

# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA):

The front end development used in this project included Express HTML, JavaScript, and an SPA. The use of Express allowed me to create a working shell of a website quickly. The use of Javascript allowed me to develop the client-side code for the web application behavior. The SPA allows for ease of use for the users of the website, simple production and deployment, as well as scalability. 

# Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?:

The backend of this full-stack web application used a NoSQL MongoDB database to ensure flexible schemas, fast queries, and easy, fast development. The use of MongoDB allowed less coding, which in turn lead to less development time and a simple to use database structure. 

# Functionality

# How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON differs from JavaScript because JSON is typically used to format and hold data, while JavaScript includes the use of specific functions that access JSON data. JSON ties together the frontend and backend development pieces by holding the data that both ends access. The front end displays the JSON data, while the backend stores it. 

# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Throughout this full-stack application development process, each piece was developed incrementally. I started the application by creating the Express website shell. This shell was then altered and improved upon by adding additional functionality. The first change was MVC routing, followed by converting static HTML to templates using JSON, then I added a NoSQL database, RESTful API, an SPA using Angular, followed last by security features such as a log in. Working with reusable UI components is beneficial because it allows for easy customization and scalability. 

# Testing

# Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Methods, endpoints, and security are essential in a full-stack application. Methods are used for request and retrieval of functions and data. These can be tested using API endpoints to retrieve the functions and test using sample data. Security is also crucial for a full stack application, because the application contains sensitive data that needs to be protected. 

# Reflection

# How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has helped me to achieve my professional goals because it has taught me the basics of developing a full stack application. I did not understand the full scope of developing a full-stack application before taking this course, so I am walking away with very valuable information as I go forward towards my career in computer science. I now am also fully versed in the MEAN stack development structure, which will help me become a more marketable candidate in my career field.
